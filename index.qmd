I'm a Master's student in Digital Marketing with a background in film production and a passion for storytelling through data and design. My portfolio showcases projects that combine marketing analytics and creative strategy to help brands grow smarter in a digital world.

This site features selected work in marketing strategy, data visualization, and analytics modeling. Whether itâ€™s understanding post-COVID consumer behaviors or building dashboards to track brand health, I strive to bring clarity and creativity to data-driven decision-making.
