Below are selected projects that reflect my hands-on experience applying marketing analytics to real-world problems, bridging data, storytelling, and strategy. Each project showcases how I use tools like R, Quarto, and dashboards to surface insights that inform smarter marketing decisions.

Whether I’m building dashboards to visualize campaign trends, analyzing audience behavior post-COVID, or using SEO and search data to guide content strategy, I’m driven by a desire to make complex data more intuitive, engaging, and actionable.
